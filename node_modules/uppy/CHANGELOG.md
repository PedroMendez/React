Our combined changelog and roadmap. It contains todos as well as dones.

Items can be optionally be tagged tagged by GitHub owner issue if discussion
happened / is needed.

Please add your entries in this format:

Following [SemVer spec item 4](http://semver.org/#spec-item-4),

## Backlog

Ideas that will be planned and find their way into a release at one point

- [ ] build: investigate Rollup someday, for tree-shaking and smaller dist https://github.com/substack/node-browserify/issues/1379#issuecomment-183383199, https://github.com/nolanlawson/rollupify, https://github.com/nolanlawson/rollup-comparison
- [ ] core: Decouple rendering from Plugins and try to make Uppy work with React (add basic example) to remain aware of possible issues (@hedgerh), look at https://github.com/akiran/react-slick, https://github.com/nosir/cleave.js
- [ ] core: Have base styles, be explicit about fonts, etc
- [ ] core: Make sure Uppy works well in VR
- [ ] test: Human should check http://www.webpagetest.org and https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/, use it sometimes to test website and Uppy. Will show response/loading times and other issues
- [ ] test: Human should test with real screen reader to identify accessibility problems
- [ ] test: Make Edge and Safari work via the tunnel so we can test localhost instead of uppy.io, and test the current build, vs the previous deploy that way
- [ ] test: setup an HTML page with all sorts of crazy styles, resets & bootstrap to see what brakes Uppy (@arturi)
- [ ] dependencies: es6-promise --> lie https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie ?
- [ ] core: accessibility research: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb, http://khan.github.io/tota11y/
- [ ] core: see if it‚Äôs possible to add webworkers or use pica for thumbnail generation (@arturi)
- [ ] website: Would one really connect a own google drive or dropbox for testing purpose? => maybe one can give something like a testing account of google drive and dropbox to try uppy
- [ ] dashboard: maybe add perfect scrollbar https://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar (@arturi)
- [ ] ui: do we want https://github.com/kazzkiq/balloon.css ?
- [ ] core: consider adding presets, see https://github.com/cssinjs/jss-preset-default/blob/master/src/index.js (@arturi)
- [ ] uppy/uppy-server: Transfer files between providers (from instagram to Google drive for example).
- [ ] uppy/uppy-server: review websocket connection and throttling progress events (@arturi, @ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] uploaders: consider not showing progress updates from the server after an upload‚Äôs been paused (@arturi, @ifedapoolarewaju)
- [ ] image cropping on the client (#151)
- [ ] maybe restrict system file picking dialog too https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/253
- [ ] uppy-server: what happens if access token expires amid an upload/download process.
- [ ] good way to change plugin options at runtime‚Äîmaybe `this.state.options`?
- [ ] s3: multipart/"resumable" uploads for large files (@goto-bus-stop)
- [ ] uppy-server/s3: make s3 endpoint more configurable (@goto-bus-stop)
- [ ] DnD Bar ? (@arturi)
- [ ] possibility to work on already uploaded / in progress files #112, #113
- [ ] possibility to edit/delete more than one file at once #118, #97
- [ ] optimize problematic filenames #72
- [ ] an uploader plugin to receive files in a callback instead of uploading them
- [ ] core: calling `upload` immediately after `addFile` does not upload all files (#249 @goto-bus-stop)

## 1.0 Goals

What we need to do to release Uppy 1.0

- [x] feature: restrictions: by size, number of files, file type
- [x] feature: beta file recovering after closed tab / browser crash
- [ ] feature: improved UI for Provider, Google Drive and Instagram, grid/list views
- [x] feature: finish the direct-to-s3 upload plugin and test it with the flow to then upload to :transloadit: afterwards. This is because this might influence the inner flow of the plugin architecture quite a bit
- [ ] feature: Uppy should work well with React/Redux and React Native
- [ ] feature: preset for Transloadit that mimics jQuery SDK
- [ ] QA: test how everything works together: user experience from `npm install` to production build with Webpack, using in React/Redux environment (npm pack)
- [ ] QA: test uppy server. benchmarks / stress test. multiple connections, different setups, large files. add metrics to Librato
- [ ] uppy-server: add uppy-server to main API service to scale it horizontally. for the standalone server, we could write the script to support multiple clusters. Not sure how required or neccessary this may be for Transloadit's API service.
- [ ] QA: test in multiple browsers and mobile devices, fix bugs
- [ ] QA: test with real screen reader to identify accessibility problems
- [ ] ui: refine UI, neat things up (if that‚Äôs even a word)
- [ ] refactoring: reduce size where possible, like, socket.io --> websockets (saves 20KB)
- [ ] refactoring: possibly add CSS-in-JS
- [ ] refactoring: possibly switch from Yo-Yo to Preact, because it‚Äôs more stable, solves a few issues we are struggling with (like onload/onunload being weird in yo-yo) and mature, ‚Äúnew standard‚Äù, larger community
- [ ] refactoring: possibly differentiate UI plugins from logic plugins, so that, say Tus plugin doesn‚Äôt include rendering stuff
- [ ] refactoring: webcam plugin
- [ ] refactoring: clean up code everywhere
- [ ] docs: on using plugins, all options, list of plugins, i18n
- [ ] uppy-server: better error handling, general cleanup (remove unused code. etc)
- [ ] uppy-server: security audit

## 0.20.0

- [ ] webcam: look into simplifying / improving webcam plugin, only showing the tab when webcam is available (@arturi, @goto-bus-stop)
- [ ] provider: improve UI: add icons for file types? (@arturi)
- [ ] core: css-in-js, while keeping non-random classnames (ideally prefixed) and useful preprocessor features. also see simple https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/master/lib/codemirror.css (@arturi, @goto-bus-stop)
- [ ] core: research !important styles to be immune to any environment/page. Maybe use smth like `postcss-safe-important`. Or increase specificity (with .Uppy) (@arturi)
- [ ] test: add https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y for automated accessibility testing (@arturi)
- [ ] test: add tests for `npm install uppy` and running in different browsers, the real world use case (@arturi)
- [ ] core: Uppy ID per instance
- [ ] add `FormEncapsulator`: a plugin that is used in conjunction with any other acquirer, responsible for injecting any result (like from Transloadit plugin) back into the form (jquery-sdk includes the whole Assembly Status JSON in a hidden field i think)
- [ ] dashboard: allow minimizing the Dashboard during upload (Uppy then becomes just a tiny progress indicator) (@arturi)
